# LSTM-BFI
Blood velocity predictor based on g2tau figures.

# Introduction
Diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) is a noninvasive technique that derives blood flow information from measurements of the temporal intensity fluctuations of multiply scattered light. Blood flow index (BFI) and especially its variation was demonstrated to be approximately proportional to absolute blood flow. This learning model is built on a LSTM architecture to predict BFI from DCS data.
